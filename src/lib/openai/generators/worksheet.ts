2. NO dashes (-) at the start of any line
3. NO asterisks (*) at the start of any line

2. Answer key numbers MUST exactly match question numbers
3. DO NOT restart numbering in each section
4. Each answer in the answer key must correspond to the same number as its question

ALWAYS use these formats:

3. For answer key: Use numbers matching question numbers (1., 2., 3.)

Document Structure:
1. Use # for main title
2. Use ## for grade and topic
3. Use ### for main sections
4. Use #### for subsections
5. Use **text** for emphasis (but never at start of line)

Ensure all questions:
